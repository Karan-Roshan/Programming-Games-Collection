# Rock Paper Scissors – C Language
A simple **console-based Rock–Paper–Scissors game** developed in **C**, where a player competes against the computer.  
The project demonstrates the use of **random number generation, conditional logic, functions, and loops** in C programming.


## Features
- Player vs Computer gameplay  
- Randomized computer moves using `rand()`  
- Game logic implemented using functions  
- Score tracking for both player and computer  
- Final result announcement (Win / Lose / Draw)  
- Clean and interactive terminal UI  


## Technologies Used
- **Language:** C  
- **Libraries:**
  - `stdio.h`
  - `stdlib.h`
  - `time.h`


## How the Game Works
1. The player chooses:
   - `1` → Rock  
   - `2` → Paper  
   - `3` → Scissors  

2. The computer randomly selects one option.
3. The winner of each round is decided using standard Rock–Paper–Scissors rules.
4. The game runs for **3 rounds**.
5. Final scores are compared and the winner is declared.
